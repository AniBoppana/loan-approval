## California Mortgage Loan Approval: 
# An end-to-end project analyzing loan approval patterns across California's counties using Python, SQL and Power BI

# Goals
- Build an organized star schema as the structure for this dataset
- Train an ML model in Python to predict approval
- Build Power BI Dashboards to visualize trends with regional drillthroughs

# Project Roadmap
- M0: Repo creation and scaffolding
- M1: Dataset acquisition and staging
- M2: Data cleaning and preparation
- M3: Power BI Reports & Dashboards
- M4: ML Baseline Modeling (Random Forest Classification)
- M5: Documentation and Packaging

# Tech Stack
- Data Processing: MySQL, Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Power BI (ArcGIS maps, drillthroughs, gauges, scatterplots)
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Random Forests, ROC/AUC, feature importance)
- Version Control: Git/GitHub
